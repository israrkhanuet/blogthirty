## 1. Introduction to Remint Network

Remint Network is a real estate cryptocurrency token on the BNB Smart Chain, with the core objective of transforming the real estate market through the integration of blockchain technology. It is described in the white paper that Remint Network is the solution to insufficient resources and outdated processes in the real estate industry, which is due to a lack of adequate technology, causing inefficiency and unnecessary expenses within the market on a global scale. To address this problem, Remint will build a platform that handles various real estate deals fueled by smart contracts that enable individuals to make real estate deals, e.g., buying and renting out properties in a decentralized fashion through a peer-to-peer network.

Mining App was released on April 12, 2021. [Go to Remint Network home page to see the white paper](https://remintnetwork.com/whitepaper).

## 2. Team

Remint Network was founded in May 2021 by Max Hellström and Anton Broman. They met back in 2017 when they both worked as financial advisors at Santander bank (4th largest bank in Europe). Both founders have been crypto enthusiasts since the beginning of 2017 after witnessing Ethereum’s sudden rise and recognizing blockchain’s true potential in numerous sectors, e.g., finance and real estate.

Since then, they have accumulated significant knowledge and expertise in the blockchain field that spans nearly six years. Moreover, by actively evaluating the market, analyzing blockchain projects, and trading countless cryptocurrencies, they reached a point where they came to the conclusion to start Remint Network.

## 3. Features

### 3.1 Tokenomics/total supply of tokens

A minimum of 550 million tokens and a maximum of 1.9 billion tokens will be issued. The final total supply is primarily determined by the total amount of active miners at a given time and the total amount of coins pre-mined at a given time.

### 3.2 Protocol chain

Remint Coin is a BEP-20 token based on the BNB Smart Chain. BNB Smart Chain (short as “BSC” for the below sections) operates in parallel with the Binance Chain (BC). Instead of having a layer 2-solution, the two are separate blockchains operating in tandem, forming the Binance Chain. BSC has implemented native cross-chain communication, which enables the blockchain to take advantage of the dual-chain architecture; hence, BSC can benefit from Binance Chain’s high-speed transactions, along with other qualities that the coexisting chain offers. Furthermore, BSC’s transaction fees are exceptionally low, especially in contrast to all the applicable features that come with the blockchain.

### 3.3 Referral System of Remint Network

If you collect a lot of referrals, the mining speed will increase.If you want to use my referal code
**ZOQRXSM1** by using my code you will get 10 free coins and 25% of my active mining reward.

### 3.4 Dapp platform

A decentralized real estate application will be developed and added to the Remint ecosystem. The software fueled by smart contracts will provide a decentralized marketplace for buyers and sellers to make various real estate deals (e.g., buying and renting out properties) without intermediaries and central oversight. The platform will split into two marketplaces; a rental marketplace for accommodation similar to Airbnb, and a marketplace for residential properties and vacation homes. The Remint token will be used as the main currency of the application. However, other cryptocurrencies are accepted as well.
